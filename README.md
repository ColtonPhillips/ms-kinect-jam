Broken Mirror

This gem has a cool story. So I was coopted by a pal to do a jam at a microsoft event. I was sorta kinda into it (I think I was really busy at the time) and I showed up. My partner really relied on me to do all the coding but she was a lot of fun to work with. I showed up for one day, cranked this out, and won 3rd place even after everyone else coded for an extra 2 days. That won me and her both a Kinect, and a bit of humblebragging rights. After this went down Microsoft Victoria closed shop and all that was left was the massive ammount of swag they gave away.
